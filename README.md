# table-tennis-game-test-006

## Project Brief
Create a single HTML/CSS/JS application that implements a simple 2D Table Tennis (Pong-style) game. The game should feature a playing area, a net, two paddles (one player-controlled, one AI-controlled), and a ball. The user must be able to move their paddle vertically, and the ball must bounce off paddles and walls. Include a score display that updates when a player misses the ball.

## Setup
